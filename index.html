        MK Online contains all of my newest programming and art projects. As an aspiring coder, I enjoy working with Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Javascript (JS). One of my latest adventures is learning C++, one of the most fundamental computer languages. I hope to see many C++ games and other applications below soon. Art projects posted will include photorealistic renderings, architectural designs, and miscellaneous hand drawings.
      </p>

        This website is constantly being updated, so stay posted for lots of interesting projects.

        SuperSkin is a collection of elegant faceplates for the <a class = "link" href = "https://thomasokken.com/free42">Free42</a> desktop calculator. This collection was assembled through a joint effort by Perry Thompson and MK Studios. New faceplate designs are always coming!

        To install a SuperSkin, simply download both the image (.gif) and inner code (.layout) files. Move them into the folder containing the Free42 executable. The new themes should now appear under the "Skin" dropdown in the toolbar of the calculator.

        Crystal Grower v3
      </h3>
      <hr>
      <p data-animate = "fadeInRight">
        Crystal Grower is a Javascript-based video game which I first built on Khan Academy. Version 3 is a complete rebuild which does not use any external libraries.
      </p>
      <p data-animate = "fadeIn">
        Remember, Crystal Grower v3 is merely a video game (don't spend too much time on it!). If you are interested in <em>real</em> crystal growing, do some research on how crystals are made and how they are used. The instructions are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul data-animate = "fadeInLeft">
        <li>
          Click and hold the mouse button over the game area to make the crystal seed float up. (This is more difficult on tap screen devices.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to catch the solution droplets (they're a different color each time). The solute material will precipitate onto your crystal and make it grow larger. The amount your crystal grows depends on the size of the droplet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid the water droplets (always blue). These will dissolve some of your crystal away reducing the value. Once again, the amount the solvent shrinks your crystal depends on the size of the solvent drop.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try all you can to avoid the blocks of dynamite. They will shatter your crystal, whose value becomes absolutely <em>zero</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
