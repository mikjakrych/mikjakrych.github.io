        <h2>
          Rental Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          Please review this list of criteria. If you feel you meet the criteria, please apply. Note that equal housing opportunity is provided: we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, national origin, family status, or political affiliation. If you meet the application criteria and are accepted, you will have the peace of mind of knowing that other renters in this area are being screened with equal care, and as a result, there may be a reduced risk of illegal activity occurring in the area. The criteria for rental is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A complete application and fee. One for each adult (18 years or older). If a line isn't filled in, of the omission explained satisfactorily, we will return the application back to you. CASH WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rental history verifiable from unbiased sources. If you are related by blood or marriage to one of the previous landlords listed, or your rental history does not include at least two previous landlords, we will require: a qualified co-signer on your rental agreement (qualified co-signers must meet all applicant screening criteria and pay processing fee) or an additional security deposit and/or last month’s rent. It is your responsibility to provide us with the information necessary to contact your past landlords. We reserve the right to deny your application if, after making a good faith effort, we are unable to verify your rental history. If you owned, rather than rented your previous home, you will need to furnish mortgage company references and proof of title ownership or transfer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sufficient income/resources. We must be able to verify independently the amount and stability of your income (for example: through pay stubs, employer/source contact, or tax records. If self-employed: business license, tax records, band records, or a list of client references).
          </li>
          <li>
            Two pieces of I.D. must be shown. We require a photo I.D. (a driver’s license or other government issued photo identification card) and a second piece of I.D. as well. Present with completed application.
          </li>
          <li>
            False information is grounds for denial. You will be denied rental if you mis-represent any information on the application. If misrepresentations are found after a rental agreement is signed, your rental agreement will be terminated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Criminal convictions or certain types of crimes will result in denial of your application. You will be denied rental if you have been convicted for any type of crime that would be considered a serious threat to real property or to other residents’ peaceful enjoyment of the premises, including the manufacture or distribution of controlled substances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Certain court judgments against you may result in denial of your application. If, in the last 10 years, you have been through a court ordered eviction, or had any judgement against you for financial delinquency, your application will be denied.
          </li>
          <li>
            Active bank account required.
          </li>
          <li>
            Poor credit record (overdue accounts) may result in denial of your application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Poor references from previous landlords may result in denial of your application.
          </li>
