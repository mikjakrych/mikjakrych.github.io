          In the spring of 1890, Allen C. Mason of Tacoma built The Mason Block, now known as Sycamore Square. This three-story brick building with a mezzanine, cost $50,000.00 to construct. Mr. Mason advertised extensively in eastern newspapers to attract investors; his glowing ads brought millions of dollars to the northwest. Mr. Mason attended to every detail from land selection to the landscaping of the completed project. He developed them with prudence, financial strength, sound marketing and unwavering integrity. He was a true visionary. Like many other buildings in the area, it was designed as an office building with residential on the top floor and commercial space on the ground floor. It is now the oldest building in Fairhaven.
