Just ask anyone if they know where Sycamore Square is located, they will tell you the big brick building on the corner of 12th and Harris!
        </p>
        <p>
          Built in the spring of 1890 Sycamore Square was originally Known as the Mason Block. In the early 70's the building was renamed The Market Place. Patrick Uy purchased and renovated the building in 1994 and renamed it Sycamore Square. Through the years Sycamore Square has undergone many changes, however she has never lost her historic ambience. With the Exposed brick, 12' foot ceilings and outstanding woodwork the splendor of the 1890's have always remained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sycamore Square has a wide variety of tenants. Two Restaurants, Music Store, Art Gallery, Shoe Store, Financial Advisors, Hair Salons, Individual Stock Traders, to name a few. Sycamore Square is a community all it's own, with a small town feeling. Often you will see tenants gathering on the landings talking about what's new ( shooting the bull as it's known in most small towns ).
        </p>
        <p>
          We have plenty of parking, Sycamore Square owns the parking lot on the north and east corner of 13th and Harris. We also have the convenience of an elevator and handicap accessible bathrooms. The open balconies and atrium give the building a touch of splendor and class. If you have never visited Sycamore Square, it is a must see experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Patrick Uy purchased the Mason Block in 1995 which he renamed Sycamore Square. At the time of purchase the building was in need of major renovations. Mr Uy dedicated a lot of time and energy to the project. The restoration produced a feeling of splendor. Many people stop by to enjoy the ambience of this building.
